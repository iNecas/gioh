# Milestone 8: Finished

**Congratulations**: you've just built an HTTP server, client and throttled
proxy, and also learned quite a lot from the Go lang, including:

- go commands (build, run, fmt)
- variables
- pointers
- functions
- constants
- packages
- structs
- types
- interfaces
- defer
- channels
- goroutines
- `fmt`, `log`, `net/http`, `time` and other packages

This branch contains the finalized project, in case you missed anything.

If you liked (or didn't like) the workshop, don't hesitate to [provide your feedback](https://devconfcz2019.sched.com/event/JjF8/go-for-newbies).
